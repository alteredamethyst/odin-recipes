        <p>Who doesn't love greesy, buttery potatoes?</p>
        <h4>Ingredients: </h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound medium red or Yukon Gold potatoes (3 to 4)</li>
            <li>1 1/2 to 2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt, divided, plus more as needed</li>
            <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>Finely chopped fresh herbs, such as 1 teaspoon thyme or oregano, or 1/2 teaspoon rosemary </li>
            <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Instructions: </h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Quarter 1 pound red or Yukon gold potatoes lengthwise, then cut each<br> piece crosswise into 1-inch wide chunks. Heat 2 tablespoons vegetable<br> oil in a 10 to 12-inch cast iron skillet over medium heat until shimmering.<br> (Alternatively, use a nonstick skillet and 1 1/2 tablespoons oil.) Add the<br> potatoes, arrange in a single layer cut-side down, and season with 1/2<br> teaspoon of the kosher salt.</li>
            <li>Cover with a tightfitting lid and cook undisturbed until the potatoes are<br> tender and the bottoms are golden brown, about 20 minutes. Meanwhile,<br> finely chop the herb of your choice, 1 teaspoon thyme or oregano, or 1/2<br> teaspoon rosemary.</li>
            <li>Uncover and flip each piece with tongs to a second cut side. Season with<br> the remaining 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt and a few grinds of black pepper.<br> Increase the heat to medium high and cook uncovered until the second<br> side is golden brown, 5 to 10 minutes more, moving the pieces around as<br> needed so they brown evenly.</li>
            <li>Add the herb and 1 tablespoon unsalted butter if desired and cook,<br> tossing occasionally, until the butter is melted and the herbs are fragrant,<br> about 1 minute. Taste and season with more salt as needed.</li>
        </ol>
