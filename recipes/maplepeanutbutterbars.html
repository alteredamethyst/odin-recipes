        <p>These maple peanut butter bars are super good. They only take around 45 minutes, too!</p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul><h5>Bars:</h5>
            <li>½ cup unsalted butter, cut into pieces</li>
            <li>1 cup creamy peanut butter at room temperature</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups light brown sugar, make sure it is fresh and soft</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 ¾ cups all purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        </ul>
        <ul><h5>Icing</h5>
            <li>6 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into pieces</li>
            <li>½ cup creamy peanut butter</li>
            <li>¼ cup milk</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
            <li>2 scant cups powdered sugar</li>
            <li>½ cup roasted salted peanuts, chopped</li>
            <li>Flaky sea salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Instructions:</h4>
        <ol><h5>Bars</h5>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350°F. Line a 9×13 pan with foil or parchment paper, leaving overhang<br> on at two sides for easy removal. Grease the foil or parchment, set aside.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, microwave butter and peanut butter until melted and smooth. Add brown<br> sugar, whisking until combined. Add eggs and vanilla, whisk until combined, stopping to<br> scrape the sides of the bowl as needed.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, combine flour, baking powder, and salt. Add flour mixture to the wet<br> ingredients and stir with a rubber spatula until combined. Stir just until no streaks of<br> flour remain, and be careful not to overmix. The batter will be thick.</li>
            <li>Transfer the batter to the prepared pan and press it into an even layer. Bake for 17-20<br> minutes, until light golden brown. </li>
        </ol>
        <ol><h5>Icing</h5>
            <li>Once the bars are baked, remove the bars from the oven and place the pan on a wire rack.<br> Immediately proceed with the frosting.</li>
            <li>Place butter, peanut butter, and milk in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring the mixture to<br> a simmer, whisking frequently, then remove from the heat. Immediately whisk in vanilla<br> extract and powdered sugar, whisking until smooth and combined. Pour over the warm bars<br> and spread into an even layer. Work quickly; this frosting will firm up fast. Sprinkle with<br> peanuts and flaky sea salt, lightly pressing the peanuts into the frosting. Allow the bars to<br> cool and the frosting to set before cutting and serving.</li>
        </ol>
